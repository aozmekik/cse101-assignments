In this assignment you will design an algorithm of the montage of a worktable.
The following figure illustrates the steps to montage the furniture properly. You
are supposed to write a corresponding algorithm.

1. Determine the primitives (building blocks, the syntax) of your algorithm
2. Create a table representing what the primitives you defined corresponds to
    (the semantics of your primitives)
3. Using the primitives write the algorithm step by step.

Create a PDF file of your work and upload on moodle in the following form:

_<std_number>_ .pdf

Please ask your questions via asturan@gtu.edu.tr and do not send messages
through moodle.
