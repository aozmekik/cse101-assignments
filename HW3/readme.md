1. Write an assembly program which creates two variables named a
    and b, assigns them some integer and calculates **_a mod b_** and
    prints the result to the screen. Upload your .asm file on moodle. The
    file name should be in the form of :
    number_name_surname (exp: 17090909_ayse_serbetci.asm).
    Different file name will lose point.

Question 2,3 and 4 will be submitted in a single pdf file. The file
name should be in the same in the form of :
number_name_surname (exp: 17090909_ayse_serbetci.pdf).
Different file name will lose point.

2. List the components included in the kernel of an operating system
    and explain each with a small paragraph (in Turkish).
3. A file system is the part of operating systems that controls how the
    data is stored and retrieved. Explain the file systems of UNIX and
    Windows in detail and list advantages and disadvantages of both
    (one or two pages in Turkish).
4. If a typist types 60 words per minute (wherea word is considered five
    characters), how much time would pass between typing each
    character? If a multiprogramming operating system allocated time
    slices in 10 millisecond units and we ignore the time required for
    process switches, how many time slices could be allocated between
    characters being typed? Show and explain your steps.
